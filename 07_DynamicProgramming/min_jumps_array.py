# Min Jumps Array
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-jumps-array/
#
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
#
# Example :
# Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
#
# The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
#
# If it is not possible to reach the end index, return -1.
#

    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def jump(self, A):

        if len(A) == 1:
            return 0

        for i, a in enumerate(A):

            if i > curr_max:

            curr_max = max(i + a, curr_max)

            if curr_max >= len(A) - 1:
                return jumps + 1

            if i == prev_max:
                prev_max, jumps = curr_max, jumps + 1

        return jumps
