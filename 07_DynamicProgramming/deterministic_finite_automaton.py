# Deterministic Finite Automaton
# https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/deterministic-finite-automaton
#
# Deterministic finite automaton(DFA) is a finite state machine that accepts/rejects finite
# strings of symbols and only produces a unique computation (or run) of the automation for each
# input string.
#
# DFAs can be represented using state diagrams. For example, in the automaton shown below,
# there are three states: S0, S1, and S2 (denoted graphically by circles). The automaton
# takes a finite sequence of 0s and 1s as input. For each state, there is a transition arrow
# leading out to a next state for both 0 and 1. Upon reading a symbol, a DFA jumps deterministically
# from a state to another by following the transition arrow. For example, if the automaton is
# currently in state S0 and current input symbol is 1 then it deterministically jumps to state
# S1. A DFA has a start state (denoted graphically by an arrow coming in from nowhere) where
# computations begin, and a set of accept states (denoted graphically by a double circle) which
# help define when a computation is successful.
#
# These are some strings above DFA accepts,
#
# 0
# 00
# 000
# 11
# 110
# 1001
# You are given a DFA in input and an integer N. You have to tell how many distinct strings of
# length N the given DFA accepts. Return answer modulo 109+7.
#
# Notes
#
# Assume each state has two outgoing edges(one for 0 and one for 1). Both outgoing edges won’t
# go to the same state.
# There could be multiple accept states, but only one start state.
# A start state could also be an accept state.
# Input format
#
# States are numbered from 0 to K-1, where K is total number of states in DFA.
# You are given three arrays A, B, C and two integers D and N.
# Array A denotes a 0 edge from state numbered i to state A[i], for all 0 ≤ i ≤ K-1
# Array B denotes a 1 edge from state numbered i to state B[i], for all 0 ≤ i ≤ K-1
# Array C contains indices of all accept states.
# Integer D denotes the start state.
# Integer N denotes you have to count how many distinct strings of length N the given DFA accepts.
# Constraints
# 1 ≤ K ≤ 50
# 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
#
# Example :
#
# For the DFA shown in image, input is
# A = [0, 2, 1]
# B = [1, 0, 2]
# C = [0]
# D = 0
#
# Input 1
# -------
# N = 2
# Strings '00' and '11' are only strings on length 2 which are accepted. So, answer is 2.
#
# Input 2
# -------
# N = 1
# String '0' is the only string. Answer is 1.
